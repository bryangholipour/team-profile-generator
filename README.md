# team-profile-generator

**Unfortunately, I ran out of time on this assignment and was unable to fully complete it. Although the app seems to function properly, I didn't have time to diagnose the multiple failed tests. See walkthrough video, thanks.**

## User Story

## Description

This is a command prompt app that creates cards of team-members/ employees. We've utilized the command line as a simple way to take input using recursive algorithms, so that the prompts will keep looping until the user is finished adding the inputs they need to add. It creates a polished HTML file with working links once the user has finished with their inputs.

## Usage

1. Enter your computer's terminal
2. give the command "node index.js"
3. Enter your team member's details into the prompts
4. Once you have no more team members to input, select QUIT
5. An HTML file will be created that shows all your team members on cards
